### Hi there 👋 my name is Anna Gutowska!

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science as a 2023 graduate of the Honors College at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Currently, I work at IBM as a Data Scientist in Developer Advocacy. I also have 2+ years of data science experience as a Research Assistant at Rutgers University. 

## My Technical Skills: 
Python, Java, R, Swift, SQL, C, Javascript, CSS, React, HTML 💻

## What Motivates Me: 
* **My involvement within the Polish community.** I was the President of Rutgers Polish Club (2022-2023) and Miss Polonia Rutgers 2021. I was also the first Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the Polish Youth Association for 3 years 🇵🇱
* **Inspiring women and all minorities to pursue tech.** I am a Data Engineer for the Percentage Project - a nonprofit organization that uncovers the true sentiment of those underrepresented in tech. 
* **Helping others.** In college, I was a Research Assistant working towards uncovering the disproportionate access to COVID-related information amongst minorities. I also volunteered as a Peer Tutor through the SAS Honors Program. I mainly tutored students in the Introduction to Computer Science (CS111) course.
