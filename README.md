and Cognitive Science. 

## My Technical Skills: 
Java, C, Python, Javascript, R, mySQL, HTML, VSCode, Eclipse, Latex, IntelliJ IDEA 💻

## What Motivates Me: 
* **My involvement within the Polish community.** I am the President of Rutgers Polish Club as well as the Miss Polonia Rutgers 2021. I am also the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the Polish Youth Association 🇵🇱
* **Inspiring women and all minorities to pursue tech.** I am a Data Engineer for the Percentage Project - a nonprofit organization that uncovers what it is really is like to be underrepresented in tech. I am also actively involved in the Rutgers Women in Computer Science club.
