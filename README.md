### Hi there 👋 my name is Anna Gutowska!

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science as a 2023 graduate of the Honors College at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. Currently, I work at IBM as an AI technical content writer and developer. I also have 2+ years of data science experience as a Research Assistant for Rutgers University. 

## My Technical Skills:

## What Motivates Me: 
* **My involvement within the Polish community.** I was the President of Rutgers Polish Club (2022-2023) as well as Miss Polonia Rutgers 2021. I am also the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the Polish Youth Association 🇵🇱
* **Inspiring women and all minorities to pursue tech.** I am a Data Engineer for the Percentage Project - a nonprofit organization that uncovers the true sentiment of those underrepresentated in tech. 
* **Helping others.** In college, I was a Research Assistant working towards uncovering the disproportionate access to Covid related information amongst minorities.
