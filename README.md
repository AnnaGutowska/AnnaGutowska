### Hi there 👋 my name is Anna Gutowska!

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science as a 2023 graduate of the Honors College at Rutgers University - New Brunswick.  

## My Technical Skills: 
Python, Java, R, Swift, SQL, C, Javascript, CSS, React, HTML 💻

## What Motivates Me: 
* **My involvement within the Polish community.** I was the President of Rutgers Polish Club (2022-2023) as well as Miss Polonia Rutgers 2021. I am also the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the Polish Youth Association 🇵🇱
* **Inspiring women and all minorities to pursue tech.** I am a Software Engineer for the Percentage Project - a nonprofit organization that uncovers the true sentiment of those underrepresentated in tech. 
* **Helping others.** In college, I was a Research Assistant working towards uncovering the disproportionate access to Covid related information amongst minorities. I also volunteered as a Peer Tutor through the SAS Honors Program. I mainly tutored students in the Introduction to Computer Science (CS111) course.
